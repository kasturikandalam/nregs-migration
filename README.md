# nregs-migration
I examine the impact of the National Rural Employment Guarantee Scheme (NREGS) on temporary migration in India using a fuzzy rdd that draws identification from the phased rollout of the program.


NREGS was implemented in districts in a phased manner. The allotment of NREGS was based on the district-level backwardness rank created by the task force set up by the Planning Commission headed by Rohini Nayyar (Nayyar Committee henceforth) that published **Identification of Backward Districts for Wage Employment and Self-Employment Programmes**. The backwardness rank was created using data from 55th round of the National Sample Survey Organisation - Employment & Unemployment Survey. 

This repository consists of NREGS district wise allocation and the ranking the allocation is based on.
